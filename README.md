In this project we created a java application that gets JSON data from MediaWiki API and parsed out each of the revisions. We then formatted and printed out each of the users and timestamps of each revision.

Suppressed depreciation warning for the purpose of the project.

To run console version of the application, go to the CommandLineInterface class and run the main function.

To run the GUI version of the application, go to the GUI class and run with Gradle.

No special build or run instructions.
